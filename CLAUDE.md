# oms-sync — rules for anyone editing this repo

- **Never remove the Bulk Refund loader** at the end of `console/easyship-tab.js` (the block marked
  `DO NOT REMOVE — loads the Bulk Refund tab`). It has been deleted by Easy Ship edits 3 times.
  When you rewrite or replace `easyship-tab.js`, copy that block to the end of the new file.
- After any change to `console/easyship-tab.js`, check: `grep -c refund-tab console/easyship-tab.js` must be 1 or more.
- The console page (`page.dalbhaat-admin-console.liquid` on Shopify) also loads the refund tab by itself
  (block `AIKM BULK REFUND LOADER`). Keep that block too when replacing the console template.
- The Loss Orders "Fix prices" panel (`console/loss-tab.js`) is loaded by the block at the end of
  `console/refund-tab.js` (`aikmLossJs`). Keep that block when replacing `refund-tab.js`.
